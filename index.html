                  <h2>Tiramisu</h2>
                  <section>
                      <p>
                        The word Tiramisù literally means “pick me up”. It comes from the Treviso dialect, “Tireme su”, Italianised into Tiramisù in the latter half of the 20th century. Historical records state that Tiramisù originated in Treviso in 1800. It is said that this dessert was invented by a clever “maitresse” of a house of pleasure in the centre of Treviso.
                        The “Siora” who ran the premises developed this aphrodisiac dessert to offer to customers at the end of the evening in order to reinvigorate them and solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives.
                        This would seem to be the origin of the Tiremesù, a natural Viagra from the 19th century, served to customers in a brothel.
                        In the centre of Treviso, an old inn of the period, the modern-day Le Beccherie restaurant added this dessert to its menu.
                        To support this legendary story, we have the ingredients of the Tiramisù, all nourishing and full of calories: eggs, sugars, lady finger biscuits, mascarpone, coffee and cocoa.
                        Over the centuries, a veil of popular prudery hid the true origins of Tiramisù. In fact it is not mentioned in books until the 1980s.
                        Evidence of the presence of this dessert over the last centuries, on the lavish tables of home is given by our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. These ladies over the age of 80 tell us of the skill and passion they put into the preparation of this dessert for family and friends. Before electricity was widely available, along with the early refrigerators, this dessert, which does not keep for long, was only eaten and known of in the province of Treviso and the surrounding areas.
                        Some particular aspects passed down orally are unmistakable proof of the Veneto and Treviso origins of this dessert. The recipe comes from the “sbatudin”, a mix of egg yolk beaten together with sugar and commonly used by Treviso farmers as a restorative for newly-weds.
                        Treviso writer Giovanni Comisso (1895-1969) was a scholar and also the most expert witness for the Tiramisù recipe. Poet Giovanni Comisso wrote in his memoirs and told even his closest friends how his grandmother, Giuseppina, a descendent of Count Odoardo Tiretta, was a lover of Tiramisù, or as she called it, “Tirame-sospiro-sù”, and she would often eat it for dinner in the winter. These historic memories tell us that the recipe and dessert were well known in Treviso as far back as 1800.
                        Traditional tiramisu contains a short list of ingredients: finger biscuits, egg yolks, sugar, coffee, mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder and sometimes liquor.

                        The original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits also allows the use of a rectangular or square pan. However, it is often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramid. Modern versions can have the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg, or both, combined with mascarpone cream. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Among the most common alcoholic changes includes the addition of Marsala. The cake is usually eaten cold.

                        Another variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble. Over time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yogurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut. These are however not considered true Tiramisu as these variations only share the layered characteristic of Tiramisu; these examples more closely resemble variations of trifle.

                        Numerous variations of Tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted breads, such as panettone, in place of ladyfingers (savoiardi).[21] Bakers living in different Italian regions often debate the use and structural qualities of utilising other types of cookies, such as pavesini for instance, in the recipe.[22] Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. Marsala wine can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu, or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahlúa.[23] Disaronno is also often used to enhance the taste of tiramisu.

                    <h2>Gulab Jamun</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai, popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives (where it is known as gulab ki janu), and Bangladesh (where it is known as golap jam), as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour.
                            In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame for a long time until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids remain. These milk solids, known as khoya, are kneaded into a dough, with a small amount of flour (maida). There are lot of ready mix gulab jamun powder on the market, which is mixed with water/milk to make the dough. The dough is then shaped into small balls and deep-fried in oil or ghee (clarified butter) at a low temperature of about 148 °C[1] until they get their familiar golden brown color. If the balls are cooked quickly, they will be raw on the inside. The fried balls are then soaked in a light sugar syrup flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.[2] Hot Gulab Jamun is also served with vanilla ice-cream.
                            Gulab jamun was first prepared in medieval Iran and was derived from a fritter that Central Asian Turkic invaders brought to India.[3] Other theory claims that it was accidentally prepared by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's personal chef.[4]

                            The word "Gulab" is derived from the Persian words gol (flower) and āb (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup. "Jamun" or "jaman" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size and shape, commonly known as black plum.[5] Jamun is also defined as a fried delicacy in sugar syrup.[6] The Arab dessert luqmat al-qadi is similar to gulab jamun, although it uses a different batter. According to the culinary historian Michael Krondl, both luqmat al-qadi and gulab jamun may have derived from a Persian dish, with rose water syrup being a common connection between the two.[7]
                            Gulab jamun gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (khoya). In other types of gulab jamun, sugar is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar caramelization gives it its dark, almost black colour, which is then called kala jam or "black jam". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted maple syrup for a gulab jamun.

Homemade gulab jamun is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter (ghee); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup.

Pantua is similar to gulab jamun, and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.[4] Ledikeni, a variation of Pantua, is another variant of gulab jamun.[8] It is said[by whom?] to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by Lady Canning, the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856–62.

Katangi, a town near Jabalpur is famous for "Jhurre Ka Rasgulla", which has been made there for the past 100 years.[9][10] It is several times the size of normal gulab jamuns and is prepared in local desi ghee.[11]

In Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi.
You can commonly find the brown and black Gulab Jamun available near you. The brown color you see is because of the solid milk and sugar content in it, which gives it a delicious taste and an eye-grabbing colour. In some varieties, sugar is mixed in the dough, which gets caramelized after frying and gives it a black color and is called Kala Jamun. Pantua is another Bengali variant, which is very much similar to traditional Gulab Jamun.

                  <h2>Baklava</h2>
                  <section>
                      <p>
                        Pâtisserie is a word associated with the kitchens of France, where bakers make the richest dough, glossiest ganache and silkiest creams before combining them into all sorts of incredible delicacies. But there is something so pretty, so flavourful and so loved from Turkey that it has won the hearts and minds of sweet-toothed people all over the world. It is, of course, baklava – a simple combination of filo pastry, nuts and sugar that comes in an incredible array of shapes and sizes.

                        The origins of this dessert are hazy, to say the least – a good handful of nations lay claim to the baklava we know today as far out as central Asia. However, it’s generally accepted that the first form of baklava came from the Assyrian empire, around 800 BC, where layers of bread dough were stretched thinly and baked with chopped nuts and honey for special occasions. As trade grew, the Ancient Greeks developed a fondness for the Assyrian delicacy and it is believed they were the ones who developed an incredibly thin dough called phyllo (leaf), which made the layers lighter and more delicate. In turn, the spice and silk routes started to influence the ingredients, with rosewater, cardamom and cinnamon becoming commonplace.
                        
                        While it’s tough to confirm these influences, it’s clear that the baklava we know and love today is thanks to the Ottoman Empire from the fifteenth century onwards. This vast empire encompassed many countries, which is why the exact origin of baklava is hard to pinpoint – each nation probably influenced or changed its recipe as they were conquered by the Ottomans. The recipe was perfected in the Topkapi Palace kitchens in seventeenth century Istanbul and quickly became a favourite of the ruling Sultan, who would give the pastries out to his soldiers on the fifteenth day of Ramadan in what became known as ‘The Baklava Parade’ – a show of strength as well as a way to show appreciation for the army.
                      
                        Baklava of some form is made in many countries today, but it’s Turkey that’s most famous for producing the delicacy. Great wide sheets of pastry are stretched so thin they become transparent, before being buttered and layered on top of one another. Pistachios from Gaziantep, Aegean almonds, walnuts or hazelnuts from the Black Sea Region are used as filling, and sugar syrup rather than honey is poured over after the initial bake.

Gaziantep is the spiritual home of baklava – particularly those made with pistachios – so much so that Gaziantep Baklavası was awarded PGI protection by the EU in 2013. Whole teams of bakers will roll out the sheets, layer them with the region’s bright green nuts, cut them into diamonds, pour over melted butter then place them in the oven before dousing them with syrup and leaving to cool. Because the nuts are so vividly covered, they’re often ground down to powder to be sprinkled over the top of the baklava, which makes them look all the more tempting.
Although the history of baklava is not well documented, its current form was probably developed in the imperial kitchens of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.[16] The Sultan presented trays of baklava to the Janissaries every 15th of the month of Ramadan in a ceremonial procession called the Baklava Alayı.[17][18]

The three main proposals for the pre-Ottoman roots of baklava are the Ancient Roman placenta cake, [19] the Central Asian Turkic tradition of layered desserts,[20] and the Persian lauzinaj.[17] There are also claims attributing baklava to the Assyrians, according to which baklava was already prepared by them in the 8th century BC.[21][22]

There are also some similarities between baklava and the Ancient Greek desserts gastris (γάστρις),[23] kopte sesamis (κοπτὴ σησαμίς), and kopton (κοπτόν) found in book XIV of the Deipnosophistae.[24][25] However, the recipe there is for a filling of nuts and honey, with a top and bottom layer of honey and ground sesame similar to modern pasteli or halva, and no dough, certainly not a flaky dough.[26]

Another recipe for a similar dessert is güllaç, a dessert found in the Turkish cuisine and considered by some as the origin of baklava.[27] It consists of layers of filo dough that are put one by one in warmed up milk with sugar. It is served with walnut and fresh pomegranate and generally eaten during Ramadan.
